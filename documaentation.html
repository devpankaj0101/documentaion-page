                <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages
                — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at
                    — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
                      — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies,
                     two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
                     <ul>
                         
                             <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page</li>
                         <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, 
                             for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
                             <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
                            
                     </ul>
                     <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example.
                          We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <p>player 1 :chris</p>
                    </code>
                    <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
                    <code class="code">
                        p {<br>
                            font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
                            letter-spacing: 1px;<br>
                            text-transform: uppercase;<br>
                            text-align: center;<br>
                            border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);<br>
                            background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);<br>
                            color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);<br>
                            box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);<br>
                            border-radius: 10px;<br>
                            padding: 3px 10px;<br>
                            display: inline-block;<br>
                            cursor: pointer;<br>
                          }<br>
                    </code>
                    <button>player1 chris</button>
                    <p>And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behaviour:</p>
                    <code class="code"><br>
                        const para = document.querySelector('p');<br>

para.addEventListener('click', updateName);<br>
<br>
function updateName() {<br>
  let name = prompt('Enter a new name');<br>
  para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;<br>
}<br>
                    </code>

                So What Can It Really Do
                </header>
                <p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common
                     programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>
                     <ul>
                             <li>
                                Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new
                                 name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example
                                 we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text
                                  label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris"
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a
                                 click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label
                             </li>
                             <li>And much more!</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript
                         language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra
                         superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.</p>
                         <p>APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement
                             programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for
                              programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take
                               ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design
                                yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the
                             correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>
                             <p>They generally fall into two categories.

                            </p>
                            <p>Browser APIs are built into your web browser, 
                                and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, 
                                or do useful complex things. For example:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The DOM (Document Object Model) API allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML,
                                         dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc.
                                          Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some 
                                          new content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example,
                                           that's the DOM in action.
                                        The Geolocation API retrieves geographical 
                                        information. This is how Google Maps is able to find your location and plot it on a map.</li>
                                    <li>The Canvas and WebGL APIs allow you to create
                                         animated 2D and 3D graphics. People are doing some amazing
                                          things using these web technologies —see Chrome Experiments and webglsamples</li>
                                    <li>Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC allow you to do really
                                         interesting things with multimedia, such as play audio and video right
                                          in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's 
                                          computer (try our simple Snapshot demo to get the idea).</li>
                                </ul>
                            <pl>Third party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to 
                                grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example:</pl>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Twitter API allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap API allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such functionality.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                 What Is JavaScript Doing On Your page</header>
                </header>
                <p>Here we'll actually start looking at some code, and while doing so, 
                    explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.

                </p>
                <p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a 
                    browser (first talked about in our How CSS works article). When you load a web
                     page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) 
                     inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes 
                     in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).

                </p>
                <p>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface,
                     via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents 
                     is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. If the JavaScript loads and
                      tries to run before the HTML and CSS it is affecting has been loaded, errors can occur.
                     You will learn ways around this later in the article, in the Script loading strategies section.</p>

                 How Do You Add JavaScript To Your Page
                </header>
                <p>JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS.
                     Whereas CSS uses <link> elements to apply external stylesheets and 
                      elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of 
                      HTML. </p>

                     will be ignored by the browser, and exist simply to provide instructions to your fellow 
                     developers on how the code works (and you, if you come back to your code after six months
                      and can't remember what you did). Comments are very useful, and you should use them often,
                       particularly for larger applications. There are two types:
